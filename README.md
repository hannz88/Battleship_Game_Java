## Introduction
This is a battleship game I wrote using Java while learning OOP. And here's a cat gif on ship (well... paperboat), because I promised there'll be cat gif(s).

## Where
You can play it [here](), which is a link to the replit site where I uploaded my code or you could download the src file and compile it.

## How to play
### 1. Set your character
The program will ask you to set your character representing you.

### 2. Read the instructions
The program will then give you the instructions. Press y to advance through them or key in ex to skip them.

### 3. Set the ships
You'll be ask to set the positions for the ships of the size 2,2,3,4, and 5. All you have to do is put in the row and column coordinate of the head of the ship. Then, you'll be asked to decide the orientation of the ship: v for vertical, h for horizontal. Make sure that the ship won't fall outside of the board. The program will warn you if it does.

### 4. Fire away!
Then, take turns and guess where the ships for the machine (the opponent) are! The winner is the first to get all ships!

## Versions
MKI implements a simple guessing algorithm where the machine will just randomly guess the player's ships' positions.
MKII will implement a local search for the machine.
